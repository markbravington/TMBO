2.0.x: Fixed non-runningness of examples! Added OOBery (not yet for number of args)
2.1.x: Tries to auto-detect correct compiler name, with optional user override in case that doesn't work; '?compile'.
2.2.x: OOB messages are _really_ nice now :) And oh yes, compile() probably works on Linux too, now.
2.3.x: fixed bug on matrix OOB checks
2.4.x: auto-attachment of TMB and offarray when and only when library(TMBO) is called; tweaks to FAQ, examples, doco
