2.4.30: Added convenience VECTORZ, MATRIXZ, ARRAYZ_<n>D for (initial) conversion from existing TMB and "vanilla" R. Also CREATE_AND_FILL_VECTORO macro.

2.4.x: auto-attachment of TMB and offarray when and only when library(TMBO) is called; tweaks to FAQ, examples, doco

2.3.x: fixed bug on matrix OOB checks

2.2.x: OOB messages are _really_ nice now :) And oh yes, compile() probably works on Linux too, now.

2.1.x: Tries to auto-detect correct compiler name, with optional user override in case that doesn't work; '?compile'.

2.0.x: Fixed non-runningness of examples! Added OOBery (not yet for number of args)
